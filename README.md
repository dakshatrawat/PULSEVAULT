# PulseVault: Centralized Healthcare Data Management

## Problem Statement

In the modern healthcare landscape, the management and access of patient health records are often fragmented and inefficient. Patients face challenges in maintaining a comprehensive history of their health data across different healthcare providers, which can lead to unnecessary repeat tests, delays in treatment, and an increased risk of errors. Moreover, the reliance on physical health cards and documents complicates the situation further, making it difficult for patients and healthcare providers to promptly access vital health information.

## Proposed Solution

PulseVault introduces a transformative approach to how health records are managed and accessed. By offering a centralized system that stores and monitors patient healthcare data, PulseVault eliminates the need for physical documents, thereby facilitating easy access to health information for patients and enabling secure sharing with healthcare providers. This streamlined process not only enhances the efficiency of healthcare delivery but also improves patient outcomes by ensuring that critical health data is readily available whenever it's needed.

## Technology Stack

- **TypeScript**: Used as the primary development language for its strong typing system, enhancing code quality and maintainability.
- **React Native**: Empowers the app with cross-platform mobile development capabilities, allowing for a single codebase to deploy on both iOS and Android.
- **React Navigation**: Provides the navigation logic for switching between screens and managing the app's navigation stack.
- **React Native Paper**: Utilized for its material design components that offer a wide range of UI elements to enhance user interface design.
- **React Vector Icons**: Offers a plethora of customizable icons, improving the visual appeal and user experience of the app.
- **Firebase**: Firebase offers a suite of tools for building and managing mobile and web applications. In PulseVault, Firebase is utilized for:
  - Authentication: Firebase Authentication handles user authentication securely, allowing users to sign in with email/password, phone numbers, or third-party providers like Google or Facebook.
  - Real-time Database: Firebase Realtime Database provides a cloud-hosted NoSQL database, allowing you to store and sync data between your users' devices in real-time. This is crucial for PulseVault to provide real-time updates and notifications for health data changes.
  - Cloud Storage: Firebase Cloud Storage offers secure file uploads and downloads directly from mobile devices, ensuring that health records and related documents can be securely stored in the cloud.


By incorporating Firebase into the technology stack, PulseVault gains additional functionalities such as secure authentication, real-time data synchronization, cloud storage, and analytics, making it a more comprehensive solution for healthcare data management.
